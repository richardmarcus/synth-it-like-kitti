### Custom CARLA installation
https://github.com/richardmarcus/carla_lidar/tree/develop
Follow instructions in readme for building CARLA, note that a special fork of UE4 is required

Optionally, start the editor via ```make launch``` and add additional maps to the UE4 configuration.
Instead of launching, use ```make package```.



### Data Generation
Make sure that the map selection matches those that CARLA is built with.
